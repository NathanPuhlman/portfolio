# My Portfolio
This portfolio contains various programming projects I've done. As it is, I haven't
had many opportunities for projects, so most of the projects in this portfolio are
for my Computer Science class over the last couple years. As I continue my career in
Computer Science, I expect to expand this portfolio by quite a bit.

## Fire Spread Sim
This was a school project in which our javafx knowledge, object oriented programming,
and cellular automata knowledge were tested. The basic idea is to design a graphical
representation of fire spread using cellular automata. The initial prompt only
expected us to implement a basic state system, in which a cell is either on fire or
not, or has plantlife or not, but I went above and beyond and also implemented
procedural terrain generation, randomized lightning strikes, soil quality, and more.

To test it, javac and java must be installed on your machine.
1. cd into `fire_spread_sim/fire_spread_sim`
2. run `javac Driver.java`
3. run `java Driver` and watch the sim play out in a separate window

The instructions we were given in this project are located in the
`fire_spread_sim/CSCI165_MidtermProject_Spring2023.pdf` file.

## Poker
This school project was the final for our first semester, in which we had to test our
ability with programming python against making a fully fledged poker simulation. In
the prompt, we're asked to simulate a deck of cards, and the dealing of cards into
hands. I added on top a full text-based game to go with it, including betting and
other CPU players.

To test it, python must be installed on your machine.
1. cd into `poker/v1`
2. run `python poker_game.py` and play poker within your terminal

The instructions we were given in this project are located in the
`poker/Final_Project_Fall_2022.pdf` file.

## Ticket Checker
This school project was much smaller than the others included here. I felt that for
the sake of completion it should be here anyway.

The basic idea behind this project is to make a program that takes user input, and
creates a reciept based on said input. Very simple, but it was my midterm so I feel
that it has some relevance.

To test it, python must be installed on your machine.
1. cd into `ticket_checker`
2. run `python midterm_handout.py`

The instructions we were given in this project are located in the
`ticket_checker/CSCI160_Midterm.pdf` file

## Save the World with a SWORD
This wasn't a school project, but I feel that it was pivotal to my development in
computer science, as it was the first test for me as to whether I could make a
complete project within the very restrictive time budget of 48 hours. I made this
project back in 2018 for a game jam, and as such it is very restricive in its scope.
However, to this day, regardless of how childish it seems to me now, I feel that it
does a lot with what it had.

Naturally I had to do all the spritework, sound effects, music, voice acting (for the
brief moment it occurs), enemies (a whopping 4!), and "story".

The program to run is located at `save_the_world_with_a_SWORD/Save the World with a
SWORD.exe`
