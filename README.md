# My Portfolio
This portfolio contains various programming projects I've done. As it is, I haven't
had many opportunities for projects, so most of the projects in this portfolio are
for my Computer Science class over the last couple years.

## Fire Spread Sim
This was a school project in which our javafx knowledge, object oriented programming,
and cellular automata knowledge were tested. The basic idea is to design a graphical
representation of fire spread using cellular automata. The initial prompt only
expected us to implement a basic state system, in which a cell is either on fire or
not, or has plantlife or not, but I went above and beyond and also implemented
procedural terrain generation, randomized lightning strikes, soil quality, and more.

To test it, javac and java must be installed on your machine.
1. cd into `fire_spread_sim/fire_spread_sim`
2. run `javac Driver.java`
3. run `java Driver` and watch the sim play out in a separate window

The instructions we were given in this project are located in the
`fire_spread_sim/CSCI165_MidtermProject_Spring2023.pdf file.`
